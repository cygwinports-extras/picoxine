ldesc: "PicoXine is a (very small) XINE implementation for playing audio 
events as a replacement for ARTS. It's extremely small (the source code 
is only 3.0KiB long!) It offers great response time, it's faster than 
MPlayer upon start-up, and it has no stdout output if no errors are 
found. It's, therefore, completely transparent."
